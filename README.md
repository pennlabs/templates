# Templates

This repo contains links to templates to start new projects with suggested Penn Labs configuration.

The goal of these templates is to make it as easy as possible to start a new project. All of the template repositories are Github templates, which means you can hit the green "Use this template" button (instead of cloning the repo) and immediately get a new repo with the desired base configuration.

Remember that these templates are just suggestions for configuration, there's no obligation to conform to them if it doesn't make sense for a specific project.

These templates aren't final either. If you think there's a new feature that should be added, or a change in configuration, feel free to make a PR on the template repository!

The current templates available are:
